This project is a budget caculator that allows users to input what category an expense was and how much it cost.  If a user types in a new category, then the monthly cost for that item will be the cost of the expense just typed.  If not, then the expense will be added to the categories current total.  Users also have the option to undo any mistakes made while typing the program, because human error is inevitable.  When the user is done typing all the expenses, a csv file is created for that month's budget.
