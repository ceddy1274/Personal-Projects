This project was created for my honors project in University Physics 1. I decided to create a videogame to demonstrate how the pythagorean theorem can be used to caculate a vector given how much it moved in the x direction and how much it moved in the y direction. I then conducted a study to see if people who have never taken physics learned better through the textbook or through the videogame.
