This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

#Test to see if the variances differ significantly between the two groups

#Documentation Reference: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/var.test

var.test(form1, form2, conf.level = .99)

```{r}
#Perform the t test

#Documentation Reference: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/t.test

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
