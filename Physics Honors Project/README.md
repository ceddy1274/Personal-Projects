# Physics Honors Project
### Description
This repository provides the source code and data for my University Physics 1 honors project. In the project, I created a video game about vector magnitude, performed a study to see how well it teaches a concept compared to a textbook, and wrote a paper on the results. The C # files were for the video game and described in the video game section of the paper. The R markdown file was used for the data analysis, and a description of the results is provided in the results section of the paper.
