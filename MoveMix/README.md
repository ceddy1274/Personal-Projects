Sport &amp; Fitness Recommendation Website I worked on as part of a team at my school's hackathon.  For this project I implemented a lot of information in the JSON file and wrote a hash table in main.js which are lines 1-194.  The hash table made it to where a sport wouldn't pop up twice until the user has seen all the sports and allowed for scalabilty of the website so the website would pop up a random sport quickly no matter how many sports were added to the JSON.
