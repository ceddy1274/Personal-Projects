This project is a website for the revamp of the University of Arkansas's Digital Design class.  It includes two games to help students understand core concepts from the class.  The first is a game called hang gate which is a game where students play hangman in order to understand logic gates better.  The other is a game called Ratatician which is game where students are given binary numbers and have to convert them correctly before the rats cross the other side.  To run the website open the file in VsCode and run "http-server -c-1" in ther terminal.
